# Cloud Docker Challenge

## 🚀 Deployment

As a cloud developer, you must configure the Docker Image to be as small as possible since storage is not cheap. Currently the docker image that got built from [Dockerfile](./deploy/Dockerfile) will result in 800MB! Can you make it as small as possible? Also help us create the [Docker Compose](./docker-compose.yml) configuration. Our application consist of 2 services, application and database. 

## ✨ What we rate

1. Small Image Size
2. Compose Exploration
